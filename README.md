# VEdit
Developed a voice-activated text editor designed to assist physically challenged users by enabling hands-free typing and editing.

Utilized speech recognition APIs (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text) to capture real-time voice commands and seamlessly convert them into text input.

Implemented custom voice commands for editing operations like selecting text, deleting, saving, and formatting, enhancing usability beyond simple dictation.

Focused on accessibility, with an intuitive interface and feedback system to confirm recognized commands and reduce errors.

Built using Python, integrating libraries such as PyAudio and Tkinter for audio processing and GUI, respectively.
